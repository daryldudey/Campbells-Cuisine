This was my first app done for somebody else - a COBOL program written when I was 15 :)

It was an order entry/management system for a company called Campbell's Cuisine.

The fixed folder contains the original modified slightly to compile with Micro Focus Cobol (not sure which version though).

It is possible to compile and run it, as I've made a CAMP.EXE from the source which runs without error.
